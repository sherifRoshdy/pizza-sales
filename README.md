## Designed a Pizza Sales Analysis project to evaluate sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue trends using ( 2 ) interactive dashboards developed in Excel and Power BI. 

### Cleaned and transformed a raw CSV dataset by addressing missing values, standardizing date formats, and categorizing product types to ensure data integrity.

# Data collection
The data source is a CSV file that contains information about pizza orders, such as order date, customer name, pizza type, quantity, price, etc. The CSV file can be downloaded.<br>

# Data cleaning
The data is cleaned and formatted through SQL queries, which eliminate duplicates, missing values, outliers, and data errors. Additionally, new columns are created for total revenue, order month, and order year. The cleaned data is then stored in a SQL database.<br>

# Data analysis
The data is analyzed using Excel and Power BI. The analysis focuses on finding answers to some business questions, such as:

    . What are the top 10 pizza types by sales revenue?
    . What are the monthly and yearly trends of pizza sales?
    . How does customer loyalty affect the pizza sales?
    . What are the best and worst performing regions by pizza sales?
    
# Data visualization
The data analysis results are presented through charts and dashboards in Power BI. These visualizations display the KPIs and trends of pizza sales in an engaging and interactive manner.<br>
